Misc Data Analysis for projects


## [Kickstarter Analysis](Kickstarter)
Final project for a course in Datascience with Python.  
#### Motivation
This dataset has initially piqued our interest as Kickstarter is a platform where practically anyone can submit a project of their own interest, with minimal barriers to entry. This means that the Kickstarter database will consist of all sorts of wacky and interesting solutions! As aspiring engineers, we have much interest towards the field of technology, especially in areas of innovation and design. Understanding part of the start-up ecosystem in SIngapore, specifically small, crowd-funded projects may give us insight towards the types of products and/or services that the local market are geared towards. This can help us in the future as we learn to cater technological solutions to the needs and desires of the population.   



## [Analysis of employment by age in the Service Industry in Singapore](sg_scv_industry)
Secondary research to conduct market analysis for Design Centric Project.
#### Motivation
My team's project aims to introduce motorized trolley attachments into the hotel industry. From our interviews and market analysis, we observed an increasing trend of aged workers entering the hotel industry, that which currently involves many labour-intensive tasks given their underutilization of technology. In order to meet the productivity demands of hotel managers, our team has decided to design a technical solution that reduces the physical rigour of housekeeping to give these older workers a competitive edge.
